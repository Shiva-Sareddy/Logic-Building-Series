# 🦾💪🏼 Coding Logic Building Journey

### 🚀 Tackling Coding Questions as a Beginner

Starting my coding journey has been both exciting and challenging. As a beginner, I’ve struggled with **logical thinking**, even though my **syntax** skills were pretty solid. But I know that mastering logic is the key to solving problems efficiently, so this repo is dedicated to improving my logical skills one question at a time!

This journey is all about **practice, persistence, and patience**. There’s no theory here—just pure problem-solving through **questions, tactics, and patterns**. 💡

### 💻 Language:
- I’m using **Java** to build and refine my problem-solving skills, focusing purely on logic.

### 📚 Resources:
As I progress, I’ll add the resources that have helped me along the way:
